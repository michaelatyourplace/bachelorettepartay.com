            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                Year-round parties flock to Charleston, SC looking for an amazing time. There are so many wonderful places to travel, restaurants to eat, and Charleston things to do, so why not? Bachelorettes, Charleston knows you are coming, so a lot of effort is taken to gain your attention in every way possible to make you comfortable and get you on board with an agenda. This blog will help you with the pub tour Charleston portion of the night's journey, for any season in Charleston.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600">
                The same places your guide or crawler offers with all the packages and perks... you will end up at anyway. Charleston is small, every popular place is on everyone's guide, tour, and so on. Plus, when you're walking down King Street, you are not going to miss these places.

            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                A lot of businesses are part of bar crawls, private event planning, and tour guides. You have already booked with several other partners they have. Any business who is not a friend misses the chance to even compete for your time, which I fall under.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                I am going to include a self-guided pub crawl guide for those who want to save money, make it affordable, pick their own path, try something different, and list places that may not be on the partnership list that you might miss out on. It is not a hidden path guide; these places can't be missed.

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4 text-center">Charleston Pub Crawl Itinerary</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                This self-guided tour is a bar crawl where everything will be in walking distance, and King Street is where you will be. This street is the perfect place to spend a whole Friday or Saturday night until 2 am eating, clubbing, and bar hopping all night.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                The most amazing part is the city of Charleston shuts down 2-lane traffic so all traffic is going one way, and there is a strong police and security presence to have a level of safety present, so here we go.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                This guide walks us right up to the corner of King and Calhoun Street where you may start considering an Uber because it's too far to walk. Everyone and I mean everyone will end up on the corner of King Street and Spring Street right where a very popular bar called **Uptown Social** is located.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                This is one of the only places you will be standing in line at per the event. They always have events going, live music, and offer a great time with younger crowds.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600">
                A lot of pub crawls offer you the VIP treatment to get into a bar first without waiting in a line but, this is the only place that really has a line and probably a must-stop.

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4 text-center">Charleston SC King Street Bar Crawling at Its Best</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                After you leave **Uptown Social** the next well-positioned place to go is **Prohibition**, it offers a Jazz Age feel vibe and has great reviews. That alone is enough to pay them a visit on your trip. While there, you may encounter some great live music and the food is amazing as well.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                The next place is the walk is **Club Republic**, it is a happening party spot. Every guided tour and non-guided ends up here and gets a picture taken in front of the "You Are Beautiful" lighting they have in the backdrop. It is another Hot Spot and a must-stop.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600">
                I will make a quick mention of Ann Street which is on the corner where Republic is located. You have **Dudleys** where you can find a drag show, **The Music Farm** which may have a long line per who is in town performing, and a neat little alley to the right of eateries like **Bodega**. I would check The Music Farm for events while in Charleston.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="content-section p-6 my-12">
            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                Let's get back on King Street. From that corner, there is not much except for eateries and some walking. Just keep walking and pass Hotel Bennett and then a big field called Marion Square. This is the last place I will mention on the pub crawl because all else is out of the walking range anyone would want.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600">
                The places I am mentioning are across the street and located on Calhoun Street, so you cross King Street and make a right at the Walgreens. The first place is **Ritual Rooftop bar**, if you are still in the mood buy a drink and feel it out. The last stop I will mention is **Frontier Lounge**, and I would do the same. They are 2 little adds within the walk that are worth mentioning.

                This nightclub hopping I have written about is an observation from someone who doesn't gain or lose from the mentions. This is not a planned-out path of people I have business partnerships with or met before in life. You can pull up a Google Maps and I have walked you down King Street of happening places on the path. This list can fill up all of your time.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600">
                I did not mention places to eat that are open or what food these places sell but places to get boozed up and happy while in Charleston SC. If drinking, big crowds, and social is your thing then here is a self-guided bar crawl free of charge. Below I will list some entertainment ideas as well of things to do back at the rental or entertainment places to go.

                These ideas of things to do that are aimed at adult parties and are worth the idea. They are not on the popular tour guide.

                There are so many replacements with an agenda for the original now geared for you, so go see the real thing. They do this because they don't want to be called strippers but are being burlesque, drag shows, pole dancing, servers, butlers, or art stuff whether male or female. Just get or go see the real thing.

                Independent dancer that you book direct and not through an agent or another business so the price is cheaper, tame to wild parties per your taste, and a REAL show that is full of choreographed stuff at your private location.
